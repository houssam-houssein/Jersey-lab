# GitHub Pages

This directory contains the built React app for **GitHub Pages**. The source lives in `client/`. Do not edit files here by hand; they are generated by the build.

**Live site:** https://houssam-houssein.github.io/Jersey-lab/

**Backend (production):** https://jerzey-lab-api.onrender.com (Render)

## Deploying updates

1. **Build the client for GitHub Pages** (from project root):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build:github
   ```
   This builds with base path `/Jersey-lab/` and writes output into `docs/`.

2. **Use the production API** (optional but recommended for live site):
   ```bash
   cd client
   set VITE_API_URL=https://jerzey-lab-api.onrender.com
   npm run build:github
   ```
   On macOS/Linux use `export VITE_API_URL=https://jerzey-lab-api.onrender.com` before the build.  
   If you don’t set `VITE_API_URL`, the built site will call `http://localhost:5000` (dev backend).

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/
   git commit -m "Update GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
   GitHub Pages will update automatically from the `docs/` folder (or the branch you configured).
